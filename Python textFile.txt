Python Indentation

- Indentation means space at the beginning of code line.
- Python uses identation to indicate a block of code.
- In other languages the indentation in code is only for readability, the identation in python is very important.
- Python will give error if you skip the identation. Number of spaces is up to programmer. But it should be at least one.

Note: We should use same number of spaces for all lines in same block of code.

To clear the terminal just type -- cls
