Python Indentation

- Indentation means space at the beginning of code line.
- Python uses identation to indicate a block of code.
- In other languages the indentation in code is only for readability, the identation in python is very important.
- Python will give error if you skip the identation. Number of spaces is up to programmer. But it should be at least one.

Note: We should use same number of spaces for all lines in same block of code.

To clear the terminal just type -- cls

Python Comments

- Comments can be used in python
  - To explain python code
  - To make code readable
  - To prevent code from execution while testing.
  
- Comments start with "#"

- Types of Comments
  - Single line comment
  - Multi line comment
  - DocString comment
  
shortcuts: ctrl + k + c   <---- to put comment on line
		   ctrl + k + u   <---- to remove comment on line
		    
			
Variables in Python

  1. Variables in python

- Variables are like containers for storing data values
- Variables names are case-sensitive
- Python has no command for declaring a variable. Variable will get create the moment you assign value to it.
- Variables can change type after they have been set. <--- it's important to know
- We can get the type of variables using type() function

  2. Variables names in python
  
- A variables name must start with a letter or the underscore character
- A variable name cannot start with a number
- A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscore ( A-z,0-9, and_)
- Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)


  3. Assign multiple values to variables

- Assign multiple values to multiple variables
	a,b,c = "apple",'ball',"cat"
	
- One value to multiple variable
	a=b=c="fruit"
