Introduction to Python | Why Python

- Python works on diffeerent platforms(Windows, Mac, Linux etc.)
- Easy to understand with simple syntax. Almost similar to English language.
- Python runs on interpreter system, meaning code can be run as soon as it is written.

Python Editors/IDEs

- PyCharm
- Sublime
- Atom
- Vim
- Spyder
- Visual Studio Code --- using this for python
- Intellij

Python Indentation

- Indentation means space at the beginning of code line.
- Python uses identation to indicate a block of code.
- In other languages the indentation in code is only for readability, the identation in python is very important.
- Python will give error if you skip the identation. Number of spaces is up to programmer. But it should be at least one.

Note: We should use same number of spaces for all lines in same block of code.

To clear the terminal just type -- cls

Python Comments

- Comments can be used in python
  - To explain python code
  - To make code readable
  - To prevent code from execution while testing.
  
- Comments start with "#"

- Types of Comments
  - Single line comment
  - Multi line comment
  - DocString comment
  
shortcuts: ctrl + k + c   <---- to put comment on line
		   ctrl + k + u   <---- to remove comment on line
		    
			
Variables in Python

  1. Variables in python

- Variables are like containers for storing data values
- Variables names are case-sensitive
- Python has no command for declaring a variable. Variable will get create the moment you assign value to it.
- Variables can change type after they have been set. <--- it's important to know
- We can get the type of variables using type() function

  2. Variables names in python
  
- A variables name must start with a letter or the underscore character
- A variable name cannot start with a number
- A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscore ( A-z,0-9, and_)
- Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)


  3. Assign multiple values to variables

- Assign multiple values to multiple variables
	a,b,c = "apple",'ball',"cat"
	
- One value to multiple variable
	a=b=c="fruit"
	

Global Variables & Local Variables in Python

 - Local Variables that are created inside a function.
 - Local Variables can be used inside function only.
 
 
 Global Variables
 
 - Variables that are created outside function know as Global variables.
 
 - Global variables can be used everywhere, both inside and outside function.
 
 - If we create a variable with same name inside function, still both local and Global variables are different. Local variables can be used only with in the function.
 

Global Keyword

 - If you would like to create global variable inside function, we should use "global" keyword
 
 - To change the value of global variable inside function, use "global" keyword.


Data Types

- In programming languages Data Types are important subject.
- Variables can store data of different data types.
- In python, the moment you assign value to variable, that's when Data Type will be set for variables.

  Built in Data Types
  
  Text Type: str
  Numeric Types: int,float,complex
  Sequence Types: list,tuple,range
  Mapping Type: dict
  Set Types: set, frozenset
  Boolean Type: bool
  Binary Types: bytes, bytearray, memoryview


Python Numbers

- There are 3 numbers types available in Python
	1. int
	2. float
	3. Complex
	
  int - it's a whole number(positive or negative) without decimals, unlimited length
  
  float - it's a decimal number(positive or negative) containing one or more decimals
  
  complex - complex numbers are written with "j" as the imaginary part


Data Type Conversion 
Type Casting

 - Strings in python are surrounded by single quote or double quote. (it's up to developer which quotes he wants to use)
 
 - To get multiline strings, we should use three quotes.
 
 - Strings in Python are like Array of characters. Hence, we can access characters in strings using indexes.
   Note:- Doesn't has character data type
   
 - Since strings are like array of characters, we can loop through them
 
 - In keyword can be used to check certain phrase or character in string
 
 - To concatenate use + symbol
